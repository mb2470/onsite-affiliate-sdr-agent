# 📧 Example Emails with Amazon Onsite Associates Proof Point

Here are example emails using Amazon's program as social proof instead of fake case studies:

---

## Example 1: Meyer Cookware (Kitchenware)

**BEFORE (with fake case study):**
```
Subject: Your recipe videos are driving sales to Instagram

Hi Sarah,

Quick question: What happens to all those chef demos your creators make 
after they post them to Instagram?

Most cookware brands pay $500-2k per video that gets maybe 48 hours of 
visibility. Then it's gone.

We help brands host that creator content permanently on product pages. 
One brand with 200+ SKUs saw 6.2x return on creator spend. ❌ FAKE

Worth a quick chat?
```

**AFTER (with Amazon proof point):**
```
Subject: Your recipe videos are driving sales to Instagram

Hi Sarah,

What happens to those chef demos after they hit Instagram? Most cookware 
brands pay $500-2k per video that disappears in 48 hours.

We bring Amazon's Onsite Associates model to creator content - host it 
permanently on your PDPs and only pay commissions on incremental sales.

Amazon proved this works at scale. We're making it available for D2C brands.

Worth a 15-min chat to see if it fits your creator strategy?

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Example 2: Fashion/Apparel Brand

**Subject:** Your creators' content is going to waste

```
Hi [Name],

You're probably paying creators $1k+ for styling content that lives 
on Instagram for 2 days, then vanishes.

Think Amazon's Onsite Associates program, but for your creator content 
on product pages. Keep the engagement onsite, extend content value, and 
only pay for actual incremental sales.

You know Amazon's model works - we're the white-label version for brands 
like yours.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Example 3: Outdoor/Lifestyle Brand

**Subject:** The leaky bucket problem

```
Hi [Name],

Your Instagram drives traffic to adventure content... on Instagram. Not 
back to your PDPs where people actually buy.

We use Amazon's Onsite commission model to host creator gear reviews 
directly on product pages. Performance-based - you only pay for 
incremental lift.

Amazon's been doing this internally for years. Now D2C brands can too.

15 minutes to walk you through it?

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Example 4: Home Goods Brand

**Subject:** Content ROI problem

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How long does that creator content you paid for actually 
generate value? 48 hours on TikTok, then it's gone.

Same model as Amazon Onsite Associates - host creator content permanently 
on PDPs, pay commissions only on incremental sales.

If it works for Amazon at their scale, imagine what it does for a focused 
catalog like yours.

Worth exploring?

Best,
[Your name]

## Follow-Up Email Example

```
Subject: Re: Amazon Onsite model for D2C

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about bringing Amazon's Onsite commission model 
to your creator content.

Quick context: Amazon pays commissions on incremental purchases when 
someone clicks from curated content to a product. It's their most 
profitable program.

We do the same thing, but with creator UGC on your PDPs instead of 
Amazon's curated lists.

5-min call to see if it makes sense for [their brand]?

[Your name]

## Breakup Email Example

```
Subject: Last note

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short - if Amazon's Onsite commission model for creator 
content doesn't interest you, no worries.

But if you're curious how they turned this into their most profitable 
channel and how it applies to D2C brands, I'm happy to walk through it.

Either way, best of luck with your creator strategy.

## Talking Track for Calls

**When they ask "How does it work?"**

"You know Amazon's Onsite Associates program? Where they show curated 
content and lists, and only pay commissions when someone clicks through 
and makes an incremental purchase?

We do exactly that, but instead of Amazon's curated lists, it's your 
creators' authentic content - recipe videos, styling shots, how-to 
demos - right on your product pages.

Performance-based, just like Amazon. You only pay when it drives actual 
incremental sales."
